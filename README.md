# SkyblockScheduler
Something to help me keep track of Hypixel events


## The Story

I'm a fairly busy person (hoping to be even more busy soon with employment) and thus, as you might imagine, keeping track of all the things I want to do on Hypixel Skyblock is pretty tricky. You need to check and skim through third-party websites or join specific discord servers for their pings (ew) and frankly, I think that's too much work for me to do when I only wanna keep track of a couple things.

Enter the SkyblockScheduler. The vision for this program is to simply send me an email whenever certain things are happening/going to happen on Hypixel Skyblock, and to provide a simple frontend UI to let users pick and choose what they want to listen for. I'm deciding to go with email because it's easily the #1 thing I pay attention too and I've never sent emails programatically before so I wanted to give it a whirl. This is also true for why I chose to use SpringBoot for this application; I want to learn it.


## Current Project Plans
This project's in it's infant stage right now, and I'm frankly still thinking about what to begin working on first, due to the fact that at the time of writing this (04/01/24) Hypixel will be updating how the Major system works, which is the most promenint use case for this application.

So I think the first thing I'll do is something simple; send myself notification for the consistent yearly events that I can reasonably attend (some sorta EST time range).

Thanks for taking a look!
